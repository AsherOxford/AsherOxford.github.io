<h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>My name is Asher Oxford, a 24 year old Australian guy who's interests lie in almost anything creative to at least some degree, 
      namely when it comes to technological based work, such as flash animation, music, video eiditng, game creation, digital art, and 
      now I have begun study within the area of coding, which along with creation of things 
      such as websites and apps, also helps futher the modern world of technological science and day to day convience. I also love 
      discovering new things, whether it be information on global historical or political events, or just simply new films and music.  </p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>I've always been interested in IT to at least some degree be it through movies or film, but predominantly the driving reason has 
      been that since around the age of 10 or so I have always been very interested in how exactly things in the modern world worked, 
      whether it be legally constructed systems such as the law and tax, or more physical things such as cars and windmills. I started my 
    actual begining in IT by doing a diploma in Game Design which including programming, as from an early age I've always loved video games
    and often fantacized about creating my own, however the industry has sadly many circumstances which have driven me to see that creative 
    pursuit as something better suited to side work or a hobby. </p>
  <p>I chose to come to RMIT primarily for the location. The backround in technology and the reviews I was hearing were of course part of the
    choice as well, but I have spent many hours in my life thus far ravelling to previous jobs or places of education routinely and find that
    it often wears me out and that those hours spent in the day doing that every week can be much better spent on personal improvement or rest.</p>
 <p>I hope to learn a basic generalised premise of IT but also to advance my knowledge to a point where I can take part in the creation and
maintenance of websites, applications, tech security, financial analysis and definately technological creation through programming. I believe 
    that the future will hold many creative opportunities for coding beyond what is currently avalible and I see it as a neat bridge to and from 
    the other creative pursuits of mine.</p>
